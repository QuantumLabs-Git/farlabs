- Inference Worker: (background worker, no HTTP endpoint)

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Services Starting Up)

Wait 2-3 minutes for services to:
1. Pull Docker images from ECR
2. Start containers
3. Pass health checks
4. Register with load balancer

**Check service status:**
```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster farlabs-cluster-free \
  --services farlabs-frontend-free
```

**View logs:**
```bash
aws logs tail /ecs/farlabs-frontend-free --follow
```

### Testing the Platform

**Test frontend:**
```bash
curl http://farlabs-alb-free-1564980524.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

**Open in browser:**
```
http://farlabs-alb-free-1564980524.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

**Test API health:**
```bash
curl http://farlabs-alb-free-1564980524.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/health
```

### Optional Enhancements

**1. Add Custom Domain**
- Point your domain to: `farlabs-alb-free-1564980524.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- Set up SSL/TLS certificate in AWS Certificate Manager

**2. Enable Monitoring**
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for service health
- Configure billing alerts

**3. Security Hardening**
- Rotate database password
- Change JWT secret key
- Enable RDS encryption (adds KMS cost)

**4. Scale When Needed**
- Increase ECS task count for higher traffic
- Upgrade instance types (will increase cost)
- Add Multi-AZ for high availability

### AWS Resources Created

**Total: 73 resources**
- 1 VPC
- 2 Subnets
- 1 Internet Gateway
- 4 Security Groups
- 1 Application Load Balancer
- 2 Target Groups
- 1 Listener + 1 Rule
- 1 ECS Cluster

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Commands

**Restart a service:**
```bash
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster farlabs-cluster-free \
  --service farlabs-frontend-free \
  --force-new-deployment
```

**View service logs:**
```bash
aws logs tail /ecs/farlabs-frontend-free --follow
aws logs tail /ecs/farlabs-auth-free --follow
aws logs tail /ecs/farlabs-api-gateway-free --follow
```

**Check service health:**
```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster farlabs-cluster-free \
  --services farlabs-frontend-free farlabs-auth-free
```

**Connect to database:**
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e PGPASSWORD="FarLabs2025SecurePass!" \
  postgres:15 \
  psql -h farlabs-postgres-free.cc9c2a8ueo1d.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
       -U farlabs_admin \
       -d farlabs
```

---

## üî• Cleanup (When Needed)

To destroy all resources and stop incurring costs:

```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

This will remove:
- All 73 AWS resources
- ECS services and tasks
- RDS database (without final snapshot)
- ElastiCache Redis
- ECR repositories and images
- S3 buckets
- Everything else

**Note:** This action is irreversible. All data will be lost.

## üìû Support & Documentation

**Related Documentation:**
- `DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md` - Initial deployment status
- `COMPLETE-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `FREE-TIER-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
- `backend/database/init.sql` - Database schema

**Troubleshooting:**
- Services not starting? Check logs with `aws logs tail`
- 503 errors? Services are still starting up, wait 2-3 minutes
- Database connection issues? Verify RDS security group allows ECS access

## ‚ú® Deployment Summary

**What Worked:**
- ‚úÖ Terraform infrastructure deployment (73 resources)
- ‚úÖ EC2-based Docker image building (cloud-native, no local Docker needed)
- ‚úÖ 6 out of 7 services successfully deployed
- ‚úÖ Database schema initialized
- ‚úÖ All within AWS free tier + $27/month for RDS & Redis

**What Was Skipped:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inference Service (requires heavy ML dependencies - torch, transformers)
  - Would significantly increase build time and image size
  - Can be added later if needed

**Total Time:** ~45 minutes from start to finish
